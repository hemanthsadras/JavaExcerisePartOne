# Java Excerise PartOne

## Contains basic array questions

1. Finding the largest number in the given array

Given an integer array you need to return the largest number from the numbers in an array, 
in any case if you find the answer cannot be found, return -101 ( this is just a special case to deal with, we could have used any other constant as well, let's just use -101 for simplicity ) 

class to be implemented : **LargestNumber**

Test class to be executed after implementation : **LargestNumberTest**

input : {5,4,3,2,1}

output : 5


2. Finding the second largest number in the given array

Given an integer array you need to return the second largest number from the numbers in an array, 
in any case if you find the answer cannot be found, return -101 

class to be implemented : **SecondHighestNumber**

Test class to be executed after implementation : **SecondHighestNumberTest**

input : {5,4,3,2,1}

output : 4


3. Finding the sum of all numbers in the given array

Given an integer array you need to return the sum of all the numbers in an array, 
in any case if you find the answer cannot be found, return -101 

class to be implemented : **SumOfArray**

Test class to be executed after implementation : **SumOfArrayTest**

input : {1,2,3}

output : 6

4. Finding a number which repeats more than once

Given an integer array you need to return number which repeats more than once in an array, 
in any case if you find the answer cannot be found, return -101 

class to be implemented : **DuplicateNumber**

Test class to be executed after implementation : **DuplicateNumberTest**

input : {1,2,3,4,1,6}

output : 1

5. Finding all numbers which repeats more than once

Given an integer array you need to return all numbers which repeats more than once in an array, 
in any case if you find the answer cannot be found, return -101 

class to be implemented : **MultipleDuplicates**

Test class to be executed after implementation : **MultipleDuplicatesTest**

input : {1,1,2,2,3,4,5}

output : {1,2}

6. Finding a number which repeats maximum number of times

Given an integer array you need to return a number which repeats maximum number of times in an array, 
in any case if you find the answer cannot be found, return -101 

class to be implemented : **FrequencyProblem**

Test class to be executed after implementation : **FrequencyProblemTest**

input : {1,2,2,2,1,3,3}

output : 2 


Once you are done with all the implementations
execute a test suite : **TestRunner**
